        <p>I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a
            programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product
            designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for
            Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle from initial product conception through the actual product
            launch.<BR></BR>
            I have a PhD. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on
            process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial
            Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
